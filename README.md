# Expense Tracker Collab Project

Andox filtered and deleted expenses. Athena calculated the total expenses. Julian added new expenses and to view all expenses.

The challenges of the project and how to overcome the problems; tell me whether your group enjoys collaborative coding or not, why or why not? Explain

Challenges: 
- Difficulty combining codes due to different variable naming: We overcame this by changing the variable names of our code as we committed it to the main branch.
- Cannot commit changes to the branch at the same time as another person without causing an error: Overcame by taking turns committing changes

Collaborative coding:
- Athena: Collaborative coding allows the project to be done quicker, however I find it to be less efficient for smaller projects. Writing only some parts of a program can cause a lack of understanding of others' code, and make the process more confusing. This may result in errors and bugs within the code, and makes debugging a lot more difficult. Since this project had multiple parts, I enjoyed the collaboration, however overall, I would prefer individual coding.
