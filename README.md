# Expense Tracker Collab Project

Andox filtered and deleted expenses. Athena calculated the total expenses. Julian added new expenses and to view all expenses.

The challenges of the project and how to overcome the problems; tell me whether your group enjoys collaborative coding or not, why or why not? Explain

Challenges: 
- Difficulty combining codes due to different variable naming: We overcame this by changing the variable names of our code as we committed it to the main branch.
- Cannot commit changes to the branch at the same time as another person without causing an error: Overcame by taking turns committing changes
- When deciding how to code the cateories for adding new expenses, we were stuck in a predicament on whether to make our own categories and have it filtered under the pre-made ones or having the user make their own categories. We chose having the user making their own because there would be too many pre-sets made. 

Collaborative coding:
- Athena: Collaborative coding allows the project to be done quicker, however I find it to be less efficient for smaller projects. Writing only some parts of a program can cause a lack of understanding of others' code, and make the process more confusing. This may result in errors and bugs within the code, and makes debugging a lot more difficult. Since this project had multiple parts, I enjoyed the collaboration, however overall, I would prefer individual coding.

- Andox: I think collaborative coding is beneficial for PRO coders, but not for amateurs. It kind of slow down the whole programming process as you have to wait for the other person to finish their part before you can start on yours. And as a beginer in coding, it is hard to understand different people's coding conventions and to merge eachother's code. Overall, I prefer coding solo.

- Julian: I found collaborative coding a good experience because it allowed the load of this project to be split evenly. Although it was a bit messy because of different functions and variables that everyone used. It would probably be easier to do it yourself on smaller projects.
